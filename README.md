## Install

This application uses an express server backend with a React app frontend within the client folder. Using this command with install all necessary modules for both the frontend and backend. In order to do this, you will need a `.env` file in both the root level and client folder with the variables contained in the `.env.example`.

```sh
npm run build
```

## Usage

For deployment, you can use the following commands to build and deploy the app.

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

For development, you will need to activate the frontend and backend separately. The method I use is having two terminals open. 

```sh
npm run dev
```

```sh
cd client/
npm run start
```

## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
